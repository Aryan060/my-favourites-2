      <h2 class="center"> Badminton  </h2>
      <p>
        I practice badminton very often, it being one of my favourite sports that I have started playing since a young age.

    <h2 class="center"> Soccer(Goalkeeping) </h2>
    <p>
      I feel the soccer position I am best at would be a Goalkeeper, hence why I practice it every day.

<h2 class="center"> Chess </h2>
<p> I play chess at least once a day, either on the phone or a physical chess board.
  I also started a pretty long time ago, back in maybe 2019
